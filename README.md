# Hai!

I'm JavaXSScript (don't mind my name).

I'm known as Baconman321 on [replit.com](https://repl.it).

I work with web-related technologies, although I *do* dream about software engineering.

You can find my portfolio [here](http://baconman321.repl.co)!

## What am I working on right now?

### Primary:

- CLIp - a terminal parser built in JavaScript

### Secondary:

None rn!


Happy coding!
